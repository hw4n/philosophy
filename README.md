# philosophy
extremely simple quote-displaying website

## plans
- any user can post a `philosophy` with their name
- a `philosophy` is equivalent to a `message to display`
- administrator has to `approve` a submitted `philosophy` before they are published
- a random `approved philosophy` will be displayed for each get request
- there will be a `copy permalink` button to copy the permalink of the `philosophy`
- that permalinked `philosophy` should have a metadata so it can be embeded in external services such as twitter, discord ...
- a lightmode / darkmode toggle button
